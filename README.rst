=====
Usage
=====
.. code-block:: python

    from PyV4L2Cam.camera import Camera

    camera = Camera('/dev/video0')

The returned frame is a bytes object in MJPEG formet. It may fall back to RGB24.
You can use opencv's imdecode to convert these to numpy arrays. This is done in
the examples directory.
